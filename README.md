# AndroidSpeckleBLE
Android Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) client for communicating with wearable heart rate sensor powered by Raspberry Pi Zero W using UART Service. First, this application begins to search for our device, using the excellent painkiller [Scanner Compat library](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-Scanner-Compat-Library/) by NordicSemiconductor, and applying some filters to refine the search. Then, when a device is connected, we'll start an UART communication with it, so we can START and STOP the heart-rate monitoring. The heart-rate values are plotted into a graph, using [GraphView](hhttps://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView/) by jjoe64.

## Prerequisites

This app asks for Bluetooth and Location permissions, and will work fine from API 23 on.
